<h1>Past Perfect, Reported Speech & Subject Questions</h1>
<h3>Level: A2–B1</h3>

<!-- 1. GRAMMAR EXPLANATION (UNCHANGED) -->
<h2>📚 1. Grammar Explanation（文法の説明）</h2>
<div class="section-box">

<h3>1. Past Perfect（過去完了）</h3>
<p>We use <b>had + past participle</b> to talk about an earlier past action.  
→ 過去のある時点より前に起こったこと。</p>
<ul>
<li>When I woke up, it had snowed.</li>
<li>She realized she had forgotten her book.</li>
<li>We got home – the match hadn’t started.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Reported Speech（間接話法）</h3>
<p>We use <b>said / told + (that)</b> + changed tense to report what someone said.</p>
<ul>
<li>‘I love you.’ → He said (that) he loved me.</li>
<li>‘I’ve just arrived.’ → She said (that) she had just arrived.</li>
<li>‘We’ll come at eight.’ → He told me (that) they would come at eight.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Subject Questions（主語の疑問文）</h3>
<p>When the question word is the subject, we don’t use do/does/did.</p>
<ul>

<h3>A Strange Discovery at Home</h3>
<p>
Yesterday, I got home and saw that the door was open. I was surprised because I had locked it. I went inside and noticed that someone had moved my books. I called my friend and told him what had happened. He said he would come over. When he arrived, he asked, “Who opened the door?” I said I didn’t know. We checked the windows, but they hadn’t been broken. It was very strange.
</p>

<h3>家で起きた不思議な出来事</h3>
<p>
昨日、家に帰るとドアが開いていました。鍵をかけたはずなので驚きました。中に入ると、本が動かされていることに気づきました。友達に電話して、何が起こったかを伝えました。彼は「すぐ行くよ」と言いました。到着すると、「誰がドアを開けたの？」と聞かれました。私は「わからない」と答えました。窓を確認しましたが、壊されていませんでした。不思議な出来事でした。
