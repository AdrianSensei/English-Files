<h2>📚 1. Grammar Explanation（文法の説明）</h2>
<p><strong>1) English verbs use different tenses to show time and aspect.</strong></p>
<p class="jp-note">英語の動詞は、時制とアスペクト（動作の状態）を表すためにさまざまな形をとります。</p>
<p><strong>2) We combine auxiliary verbs (be, have, will, do) with the main verb.</strong></p>
<p class="jp-note">助動詞（be, have, will, do など）と動詞の原形・ing形・過去分詞を組み合わせて時制を作ります。</p>
<p><strong>3) This ficha is a global reference for main tenses in A1–A2.</strong></p>
