  <h3>I Was at the Museum</h3>

  <p>
Yesterday was a special day. I was at the museum with my family. The museum was big and very quiet. There were many old pictures and interesting statues. My sister was excited, but my brother was a little bored. My parents were happy because the tickets were cheap. At noon, we were hungry, so we went to the museum café. The food was simple but good. In the evening, we were tired, but we were glad. It was a nice day.
